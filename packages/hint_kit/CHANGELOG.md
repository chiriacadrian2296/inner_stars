# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- Bubbles are spoken as semantic live regions, replacing the `SemanticsService.announce` call Android deprecates.
- Fixed `HintRegistry.resetShowOnce` doing nothing to a hint that is already on screen.
- A hint re-reads its `showOnce` flag when the key changes.
- No API changes. Tests that asserted an announcement should assert `isLiveRegion` on the bubble instead.

## 1.2.1

- Documented conditional steps, step timeouts and the two storage wires in the README.
- Linked the API reference from the README and pubspec.

## 1.2.0
