/// Positions, animates and paints a hint bubble against a target rect.

/// This is the shared engine: a tooltip, a persistent hint and a tour step
/// card are all this widget with different content and different triggers.
/// There is exactly one implementation of "measure, resolve, place, animate"
/// in the package, so all three cannot drift apart.
///
/// The widget is meant to live inside an overlay, and [targetRect] must be in
/// that overlay's coordinate space.

/// ## How the first frame is hidden
///
/// Placement needs the bubble's size, which is only known after it has been
/// laid out. On the very first frame the bubble is therefore laid out at a
/// provisional position with the entry animation still at zero, i.e. fully
/// transparent. [MeasureSize] reports the real size, placement resolves, and
/// the animation starts. The provisional frame is never visible.
