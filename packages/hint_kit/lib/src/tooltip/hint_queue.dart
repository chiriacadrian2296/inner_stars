/// Shows a series of hints one after another, without a tour.
///
/// A tour dims the screen, traps focus and takes over. Sometimes all you want
/// is three tips in order, each waiting for the last to be dismissed:
///
/// ```dart
/// final HintQueue tips = HintQueue(<HintController>[
///   _filterTip,
///   _sortTip,
///   _exportTip,
/// ]);
///
/// // Anywhere: after the first build, on a button, once per install.
/// tips.start();
/// ```
///
/// Each entry is the [HintController] of a hint whose triggers include
/// [HintTrigger.manual]. The queue opens the first, waits for it to close —
/// however it closes: a tap outside, `showDuration`, Esc, another hint taking
/// the floor — then opens the next after [gap].
///
/// It never opens a hint whose controller is not attached to a mounted hint,
/// so a queue that reaches a step on a route the user has left simply stops
/// rather than opening a bubble with nothing to point at. Use [onFinished] to
/// learn how it ended.
///
/// This is deliberately not a [TourScope]: there is no scrim, no spotlight, no
/// step card and no persistence. For those, use [HintTarget].
