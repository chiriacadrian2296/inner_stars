/// ```dart
/// MaterialApp(
///   theme: ThemeData(
///     colorSchemeSeed: Colors.indigo,
///     extensions: const <ThemeExtension<dynamic>>[
///       HintThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.black87),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// For a ready-made design, name a [HintPreset] and override only what you
/// want to differ:
///
/// ```dart
/// HintThemeData(preset: HintPreset.soft, maxWidth: 360)
/// ```
///
/// Every field is nullable. A `null` field means "fall back", and the
/// fallbacks are resolved in this order by [HintThemeData.resolve]:
///
/// 1. the per-instance `theme` passed to a `Hint` or `HintTarget`,
/// 2. the [HintThemeData] found on [ThemeData.extensions],
/// 3. the [preset] named by whichever of those set one,
/// 4. defaults derived from the ambient [ColorScheme] and [TextTheme], which
///    are designed to look correct in both light and dark mode without any
///    configuration at all.
///
/// Because resolution is per-field, a per-instance override of a single colour
/// keeps every other value from the app-wide theme — and a single override on
/// top of a [preset] keeps the rest of that design.
