/// ```dart
/// TourScope(
///   labels: TourLabels(
///     skip: context.l10n.tourSkip,
///     back: context.l10n.tourBack,
///     next: context.l10n.tourNext,
///     done: context.l10n.tourDone,
///     progress: (int step, int length) =>
///         context.l10n.tourProgress(step, length),
///   ),
///   child: const MyApp(),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// [progress] takes a callback rather than a format string because word order
/// is not universal: "2 of 5", "2 / 5" and "5 中 2" cannot all be produced by
/// substituting into one template.
///
/// A step card built with [HintTarget.contentBuilder] gets the same labels via
/// [TourStepInfo.labels], so a custom card can be localised the same way
/// without reaching for a second mechanism.
